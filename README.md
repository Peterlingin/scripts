# scripts
A bunch of scripts that don’t do anything especially useful—just a fun way to mess around and be a little creative.

**GenerateDummyText**
A PowerShell script for generating dummy text. Use the -Length parameter to set how long the text should be.

---

**Magic8Ball**
A virtual Magic 8-Ball written in PowerShell. Just like the classic plastic toy—minus the plastic. You can even enter a name to get a personalized answer.

Is it useful? Not really. Is it fun? Absolutely.

**TrumpGenColor**

A PowerShell script that spits out random quotes in classic President Trump style. Great for spicing up speeches at events, parties, weddings—if you’re brave enough.
