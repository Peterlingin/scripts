# scripts
A bunch of scripts that don’t do anything especially useful—just a fun way to mess around and be a little creative.

**GenerateDummyText**

A PowerShell script for generating dummy text. Use the -Length parameter to set how long the text should be.

---

**Magic8Ball**

A virtual Magic 8-Ball written in PowerShell. Just like the classic plastic toy—minus the plastic. You can even enter a name to get a personalized answer.

Is it useful? Not really. Is it fun? Absolutely.

**TrumpGenColor**

A PowerShell script that spits out random quotes in classic President Trump style. Great for spicing up speeches at events, parties, weddings—if you’re brave enough.

**NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter**

A simple PowerShell script that converts the first letter of each word in a phrase to its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent. This script takes a phrase as input and transforms the initial letter of every word into the corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code word. It's useful for clear communication, radio operations, spelling out acronyms, or just having fun with military-style phonetics.
* Usage *

1. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\nato-phonetic-converter.ps1
   ```

2. Enter your phrase when prompted:
   ```
   Enter a phrase: Hello World
   ```

3. View the output:
   ```
   NATO Phonetic Output:
   Hotel - Whiskey
   ```
